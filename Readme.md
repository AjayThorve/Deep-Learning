<p>Image classification using a deep L-layer neural network on cifar10 dataset to do multiclass image classification(10 classes).</p>

<p>
The code is implemented using python numpy and scipy and no other deep learning frameworks, just to gain understanding of working of neural networks as part of my DEEP LEARNING Course at NYU.
